<div ng-controller='fileCtrl'>
    <form>
        <input type='file' file-model='file'>
    </form>
    <p ng-if='file'>
        The name of your file is {{ file.name }} and the size is of {{ file.size }} bytes.
    </p>

    <p ng-if='file'>
        If you want to have something like ngChange the best way ATM is to use a $scope.$watch over the variable you pass to file-model just like in this code.
    </p>
</div>
